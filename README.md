# Ai_The Single Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW)

The single vehicle PDPTW deals with a number of customer requests that must be
satisfied by one vehicle with a known capacity. The route of the vehicle usually starts
and ends with a central depot. A request must be collected from a pickup location
before being dropped off at a corresponding delivery location, and every pickup and
delivery request is associated with a specific time window during which it must be
served. If the vehicle arrives earlier than the beginning of the designated time window
interval, it must wait until the service time begins. All requests must be served in a way
that minimizes the total travel cost of the vehicle, without violating precedence,
capacity and time windows constraints. One of the common approaches to solve this
problem is using local searching, Genetic algorithms, and CSP. Therefore, the aim of this
project is to use CSP approach to fine the routs that served requests in a way that
minimizes the total travel cost of the vehicle, without violating precedence, capacity and
time windows constraints.
